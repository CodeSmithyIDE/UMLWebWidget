# CodeSmithy - UMLWebWidget

The UMLWebWidget project provides a jQuery widget to display UML diagrams in a web page.

## Contents

- [dist](./dist): bundles ready to be used,
- [stylesheets](./stylesheets): default stylesheets that can be used with the bundles in the [dist](./dist) directory.

## Project Status

This project is in its development phase.

Many of the diagrams are ready to be used but it is likely that you will need to modify the code to suit your needs and
creating diagrams is fairly cumbersome at the moment since there is no automatic layout.

Also documentation is currently lacking and mostly limited to the samples available in this repository.

## Usage

There are 2 bundles in the [dist](./dist) directory:
- codesmithy-umlwebwidget.js is the production bundle to display UML diagrams on a web page,
- codesmithy-umlwebwidget.dev.js is the development version of the codesmithy-umlwebwidget.js bundle.

## Support
